Localhost Experiments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Ensure dependencies have been installed. The script:

       ./conf/install.sh 

   has been written for the 'blackbox' clients. Follow the steps in this script 
   with the appropriate modifications for your own system.

2) To perform the localhost experiment run:

       ./experiment_localhost.sh


Network Experiments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
NOTE: The scripts contained in conf/ have been written for our 'blackbox' 
      units. These may need to be updated (in the future) or modified for a
      different configuration. Treat these scripts as a guide.

      Modify the /etc/hosts file of both the server and clients to allow ROS
      to communicate.

1) Run ./conf/install.sh to install dependencies
2) Run ./conf/configure.sh to configure on the clients
3) Run ./conf/configure.sh to configure on the server
4) Ensure installation/configuration is correct on the server/clients.
       - All transports are functional.
       - The server can talk to the clients.
       - the client clocks are syncronised to the server via NTP.
5) Run with the appropriate transport:

       ./pong --transport <>

   on N-clients.
6) Run ./experiment_network.sh with the appropriate transport.
7) Repeat 5)-6) for 1, 2, 3 clients.
8) Repeat 5)-7) for all transports.
